## alphaess
This Python library logs in to www.alphaess.com and retrieves data on your Alpha ESS inverter, photovoltaic panels, and battery if you have one.

## Usage

Create a new Alpha ESS instance, log in, retrieve a list of Alpha ESS systems and request energy statistics of one of those Alpha ESS systems. 

## API

Currently this package uses an API that I reverse engineered the API from the Alpha ESS web app. This is an internal API subject to change at any time by Alpha ESS.
